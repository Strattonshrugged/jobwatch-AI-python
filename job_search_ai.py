PROMPT = """Search the web for current QA, software testing, and quality assurance job \
openings at companies that build connected TV apps, smart TV platforms, or set-top box / \
streaming device software. This includes companies making the devices and firmware (e.g. \
Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Google TV, Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, Comcast/Xfinity, set-top box \
vendors) as well as companies building apps FOR those platforms (streaming services, \
connected-device software vendors, smart TV ad/analytics platforms).

Focus specifically on QA Engineer, QA Analyst, Software Test Engineer, SDET, Quality \
Assurance, UAT, or similar testing-focused roles - not general software engineering roles, \
even at these companies.

Search broadly (job boards, company career pages, LinkedIn postings) rather than relying on \
memory - only include postings you can point to a real URL for.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array (no other text before or after it) of objects with these \
exact keys: "company", "title", "location", "url". If you find no relevant postings, \
respond with an empty array: []"""
